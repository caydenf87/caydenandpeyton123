    <h1>My Computer Science Experience</h1>

    <p id = "csone" class = "bubble">Coming into the computer science program at George Fox University, I had 
        no previous computer science experience. I had not taken any courses 
        or even had a full understanding of what was encompassed within 
        "Computer Science". 
    </p>

    <div class = "flexdisplay">
    <p id = "cstwo" class = "allmarginauto bubble">
        The first computer science course that I took at George Fox was Intro to 
        Computer Science where I learned the basics of computer science in the 
        Python language. I immediately fell in love with the course. The course
        flew by and I never felt that I was doing schoolwork as I loved 
        working on the projects. As I moved into my second course, I began to 
        learn about object-oriented programming and while it took me a bit of
        time to understand the concept, once I did, it just made such perfect 
        sense.

        The computer science program at George Fox University took me from 
        understanding nothing about computer science and taught me everything
        that I know today to the point where I was able to work an internship
        at Micron and have been hired to work there after graduation. The 
        program taught me how to do the best that I can and always strive to 
        improve my code no matter what it is that I'm working on.

        Why I love computer science: 
        I ended up choosing to pursue computer science because I love to problem
        solve. The aspect of computer science that I love the most is being able
        to look at a problem as a whole and bring together all the pieces to 
        create the best possible sollution. The computer science program taught 
        me all the best ways to do this and set me up for success.
