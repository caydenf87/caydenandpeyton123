    <p id = "honorsSum" class = "allmarginauto bubble">While Honors shows up on a transcript just like any other course, it is 
        more than that. In the Honors program, students are split into groups of roughly
        twenty students. Each group of students because a section (A, B or C). 
        Throughout one semester, students will read upwards of 25 books, with 
        readings of up to 200 pages. Every Tuesday and Thursday, each section 
        meets to engage in a three hour Socratic seminar on the required reading. 
        Students are encouraged both to take notes during reading and during 
        seminar.

        <p id = "personal" class = "allmarginauto bubble">The Honors program was a big part of my college experience.
            It was more than just a course and seminar was more than just a simple 
            review of the book. In Honors I found myself grappling with questions
            that would impact my entire life such as "What is the good life?" or
            "What is happiness?". During almost every semianr I discussed these
            topics with my peers, and the program has shaped my life in many ways.
            Even though I came to study computer science at college, I found 
            myself enthralled with the Honors program and gained so much from 
            being a part of it. The goal of Honors is not only to challenge 
            your own thinking but to hear a diverse array of opinions on and 
            reactions to a text in order to come to a greater understanding of
            a topic as a group. So, it is important that I include the Honors 
            program when it comes to my college experience because it was such 
            a big piece of it.
