    <h1>Intersectionality of Ethnicity/Race and Gender in relation to STEM</h1>

    <div class = "flexdisplay">

    <p id='stemSum'>What is STEM? STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, and 
      Math. The majority of Jobs in STEM fields are held by white men. Tao (2018)
      states, “… despite improvement in the numbers of women and minorities 
      pursuing STEM degrees and careers, the fields continue to suffer from 
      issues with gender equity: persistent, and in some cases increasing, 
      levels of underrepresentation of women; unequal standards and opportunities 
      for STEM women; and consistent gender earnings gap” (p.626). Why is this 
      and how can we change it?</p>
    </div>

    <div class = "flexdisplay">
    <p id='identSum'>What is intersectionality and why is it important? Proctor et al. (2017) state,
       "Intersectionality refers to the simultaneous experience of social categories such as race, 
      gender, class, and nationality and highlights the ways in which social 
      categories interact to create systems of privilege, power, discrimination, 
      and oppression (Case 2017). As a theoretical framework, intersectionality 
      compels researchers not to treat individual identity markers such as race,
       gender, and nationality as mutually exclusive categories of experience 
       and analysis, but to account for participants'; multiple identities when 
       considering how the social world is constructed" (p.359).</p>

    <p id='researchSum'>Research gives some insight into why STEM fields are dominated by white 
      men, but why is intersectionality important in research concerning this 
      topic? Proctor et al. (2017) claim, “Research that uses an intersectionality 
      frame honors its intent to the fullest by moving beyond just examining the 
      intersections of participants' multiple minoritized, marginalized, and often 
      oppressed identities to exploring how findings relate to systems of power 
      and oppression. At its core, research grounded in intersectionality is 
      social justice work that aims to interrogate and challenge inequality and 
      exclusion” (p.359).</p>

    <div class = "flexdisplayDif">
    <p id='wages'>Why might women and minorities in high school avoid pursuing a career in 
      a STEM field? The first big issue is wages. Tao (2018) says, “Earnings 
      in STEM is important to examine because earnings play a role in one's 
      decision to pursue STEM education and careers (Olitsky, 2014) and affects 
      satisfaction levels and desire to remain in the field, although less so 
      for women” (p.626). This is an issue, because this gives less incentive 
      for women and minorities to pursue a career in a STEM field, even if they 
      are interested in the fields, as they will be paid less. Tao (2018) goes
      on to say, “Some evidence of intersectionality is found in STEM educational 
      and career outcomes. Among 4-year college students, when high school 
      preparation is accounted for, Black males have 2.5 times as great odds as 
      White males of declaring a physical science and engineering major (as 
      opposed to a non-STEM major), and Black females are closer than White 
      females to White males in the odds of declaring such a major (Riegle-Crumb 
      & King, 2010).” (p.630).</p>

    <p id='norms'>The next big issue we face when it comes to representation in STEM fields
      is cultural norms. Byars-Winston and Rogers (2019) claim, “Cultural group 
      differences in science identity among STEM undergraduate students have 
      emerged in several studies. Williams and George-Jackson (2014) found that 
      male students reported slightly higher comfort with identifying themselves 
      as a scientist than their female counterparts across several STEM disciplines. 
      Byars-Winston et al. (2016) found that Latina students reported comparatively
       higher science identity than Latinos and their African American counterparts. 
       Carlone and Johnson (2007) explicitly asserted that an individual's gender, 
       racial, and ethnic identities interplay with one's science identity. ... 
       Cultural norms inherent in STEM  fields are largely characterized by White 
       and masculine values and behaviors, particularly in STEM fields where HU 
       men and women are least represented such as engineering 
       (Carlone & Johnson, 2007; Foor, Walden, & Trytten, 
       2007; Williams & GeorgeJackson, 2014). These cultural norms can complicate 
       how individuals from HU groups establish and navigate their science 
       identities as they confront ideologies about who belongs in STEM and who 
       does scientific research” (p.32)</p>


       <p id='aggression'>While cultural norms are felt more indirectly, women and minorities
         face other direct factors that influence them when it comes to pursuing
         STEM. One of these factors is microaggressions. Proctor et al. (2017) 
         state,“Being targets of racial microaggressions is among the challenges 
         REL diverse students attending higher education institutions face, as 
         demonstrated by students who participated in the I, Too, Am social media 
         campaign. Racial microaggressions are brief and commonplace daily, verbal, 
         behavioral, and environmental indignities, whether intentional or 
         unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative racial 
         slights and insults to the target person or group” (p.355). Proctor et 
         al. (2017) go on to say, “microaggressions presents a barrier to higher 
         education degree completion for some REL diverse students” (p.356). 
         How can minoritized students pursue STEM fields if they are stopped from
         even completed their degree? Proctor et al. (2017) state, "The types of
          racial microaggressions students experience often vary by 
         race/ethnicity" (p.357).

        <div id="title">Proctor et al. (2017) give the following 
          examples of microaggressions:</div>
        <p id='microagressions'>Proctor et al. (2017) claim,"African American students in Solórzano et al. (2000) reported 
          experiencing microinsults both inside (e.g., feeling invisible and 
          perceiving faculty as having low academic expectations for them) and 
          outside (e.g., assumptions that they will engage in criminal behaviors 
          in public spaces on campus) of the classroom. Similarly, both Black 
          females and males in McCabe (2009) experienced microinsults while 
          attending a PWI. Black females reported experiencing these racial 
          microaggressions the most within the classroom, which resulted in 
          them feeling both hypervisible (being expected to be the spokesperson 
          for their race and gender) and invisible (contributions not being 
          recognized). Black males experienced racial microaggressions that 
          suggested others within the college campus viewed them as threats and 
          likely to commit crime (McCabe 2009). As a consequence, Black male 
          participants reported that campus police aimed to control their bodies 
          and activities.</p>

        <div class = "flexdisplay">
          <p id="crimeSum">Another factor that is felt directly is criminal punishment. 
            Steffensmeier et al. (2017) claim, “We find strong evidence for 
            intersectionality: Harsher sentences concentrate among young black 
            males and Hispanic males of all ages, while the youngest females 
            (regardless of race/ethnicity) and some older defendants receive 
            leniency” (p.810). Similar to cultural norms, Steffensmeier et al. (2017)
            go on to say, “Attribution theory and social cognitive research 
            argue that individuals almost automatically characterize others into 
            “groups” leading to possible bias or distortion in information 
            processing and decision-making (Higgins and Molden 2003). Labeling 
            theory has generally argued that stereotypes about criminals within 
            social control agencies can influence the applications of formal 
            criminal labels” (p.814). Why is this important? Steffensmeier et al. 
            (2017) explain, “Scripts or attributions, for example, associating 
            certain demographic groups as more or less crime prone (e.g., young 
            black males vs. older white females) may lead to greater or lesser 
            sentence severity by triggering emotions of fear or sympathy in ways 
            that heighten or lessen concerns about the danger the defendant poses 
            and the perception that he or she is more deserving of punishment and 
            control” (p.816).

          <p id='forward'>So what are we to do? The first is to focus on intersectionality in
            research. Proctor et al. (2017) state, “Our findings underscore the 
            importance of using intersectionality as a theoretical and analytical 
            frame in this type of investigation. Use of intersectionality 
            compelled us to account for participants' multiple identities, 
            particularly the intersections of race and gender on their 
            experiences of racial microaggressions. Interestingly, had we not 
            used intersectionality, we may have missed the significant findings 
            related to Black males' experiences with racial microaggressions in 
            school psychology graduate education” (p.364). Proctor et al. (2017)
            go on to say, “For racially and ethnically diverse applicants to 
            school psychology programs, faculty's acknowledgment of the racial 
            climate within the program, department, and university can serve as 
            an indicator that faculty is aware and concerned about their overall
             well-being” (p.365).  Byars-Winston and Rogers (2019) say, “Finally, 
             our findings suggest that any intervention to support HU students' 
             research career intentions should consider tailoring intervention 
             content to address racial/ethnic and genderspecific dynamics that 
             may be salient in students' research selfefficacy beliefs, outcome 
             expectations, science identity, or sources of learning. Such 
             tailoring may be achieved by including case study activities that 
             capture the experiences of specific racial/ ethnic and gender groups 
             in STEM...” (p.41).
